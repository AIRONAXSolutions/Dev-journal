You need to change permissions or ownership of htdocs directory. To change the permissions use the chmod command, for example:

$sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs
To see who is currently logged user, run:

$whoami
To change the owner use the chown command:

$sudo chown -R username:username /opt/lampp/htdocs
Also, you can use find command to change the permissions only on specific files. For example, to change the permissions on all css files in htdocs directory run the following command:

sudo find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type f -name "*.css"  -exec chmod 755 {} \;
